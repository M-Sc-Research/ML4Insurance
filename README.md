# Insurance Claims Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview

Welcome to the **Insurance Claims Prediction** project! This repository aims to apply machine learning techniques to predict the number of policy claims and the total claims amount for insurance policies. By leveraging historical data and advanced analytics, we can provide insurers with actionable insights to enhance their underwriting processes, optimize claims management, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Analyze patterns and trends in historical claims data to identify key indicators affecting claim frequency and amounts.
- **Model Development**: Implement various machine learning algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) to accurately predict claims based on relevant features.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Utilize performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² to evaluate model performance and ensure reliability.
- **Visualization**: Generate visualizations to illustrate model predictions, error analysis, and insights derived from data exploration.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: (Optional) Provide a simple user interface for users to input their data and receive predictions.
